 project explores DNS-based traffic steering between IPv6-enabled 
clients and microservices. The project will function as a lightweight 
open-source alternative to L7 ingress proxies. The work removes traffic 
steering logic from the application layer by performing metrics-based 
record management on a dedicated DNS server. In this approach, the DNS 
server will decide which client is presented with which pods based on 
current cluster metrics, while traffic delivery is handled by 
conventional L3 network infrastructure instead of application-layer 
proxies. In a normal L7 proxy, the first link in the URL is usually used
 to direct the request to a pod of the correct service. What we are 
proposing is that this should be done through DNS subdomains using the 
DNS protocol, thus eliminating the need for L7 proxies in traffic 
steering. DNS-based traffic steering will allow for a larger traffic 
fanout for distributed systems without introducing chokepoints like 
those caused by L7 proxies.

Therefore, we are building a small testbed consisting of 22 Raspberry 
Pis, as this is a realistic analog to modern server infrastructure. The 
cluster will be split into groups of two, 10 client emulators and 10 
hosting the Kubernetes cluster.

Our expected outcomes are as follows:
- An open-source DNS-based Kubernetes ingress controller
- One or two open-access articles presenting our results, published and 
peer-reviewed

 of the underlying technologies used in this project are new. DNS has 
long supported multi-record resolution, and the dynamic management of 
resource records based on external metrics has been explored in prior 
work.

What differentiates this project from its predecessors is not the 
invention of new mechanisms but the use of DNS as the primary steering 
mechanism at the ingress level. Existing DNS-based steering approaches 
are typically used in a complementary role alongside L7 proxies, for 
example by large CDNs which use DNS to reduce latency and lower load on 
their ingress proxies by spreading the work over multiple server 
locations. 

This project sees DNS-based steering as a direct alternative to L7 
ingress proxies, with record pools actively managed based on pod 
metrics.  </textarea></p>

 main issues for this iteration of the project will be to create or 
explore algorithms for the efficient selection of resource records 
across the record pool. Looking at different ways of specifying metric 
thresholds as criteria for a pod being in the record pool, for example 
average or absolute thresholds. We aim to collect data on existing 
Kubernetes ingress controllers to prove the viability of our approach.

We will also look at how commonly mentioned issues with non compliant 
recursive resolvers not respecting DNS caching can be solved through 
delegation of DNS records between multiple servers through the use of NS
 records.</textarea></p>

distributed systems. Engagement will focus on releasing our DNS-based 
ingress controller as open-source software, accompanied by quantitative 
evaluation data comparing our solution with existing approaches. We will
 also reach out to developers working on related open-source standards 
and systems, such as implementations of Media over QUIC, to explore 
potential collaboration.</textarea></p>
