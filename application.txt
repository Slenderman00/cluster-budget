Proposal Name:
DNS-Based Traffic Steering for IPv6 Enabled Edge Microservices

Abstract: Can you explain the whole project and its expected outcome(s):
This project explores DNS-based traffic steering between IPv6-enabled clients and microservices. This will function as a lightweight open-source alternative
to layer 7 ingress proxies. The work removes traffic steering logic from the application layer by performing metrics-based record management on a dedicated DNS server, eliminating the need for Layer 7 ingress proxies.
In this approach, the DNS server will decide what client is presented what pods based on current cluster metrics. While traffic delivery is handled by conventional layer 3 network infrastructure instead of application-layer proxies.

This project includes building a small testbed in the form of a 22 node raspberry pi cluster. The cluster will function as an analog for modern server infrastructure, allowing us to evaluate our approach under realistic conditions. Experimental results will compare 
our DNS-based solution to conventional ingress solutions in terms of latency, scalability, resource usage and failover behaviour.

As the internet is transitioning over to IPv6 it is important to leave the inherent restrictions imposed upon us in the past, by exploring
new and more efficient traffic steering paradigms. The work we are doing is made possible due to the removal of Network Address Translation as a result of the larger address space.

Our expected outcomes are as following:
- An open-source DNS based Kubernetes ingress controller
- One or two Open access articles presenting our results, published and peer reviewed.

Have you been involved with projects or organisations relevant to this project before? And if so, can you tell us a bit about your contributions?
As an independent consultant I have been developing internal control planes for the University of Tromsø in regards to this I have several networking related contributions in Network Administration Visualized. I have also partnered with Lightside Instruments developing open-source software for NETCONF based sensor management.

Explain what the requested budget will be used for?
Does the project have other funding sources, both past and present?
A breakdown in the main tasks with associated effort is appreciated. Make rates explicit.
(If you want, you can in addition attach a full budget at the bottom of the form):
The budget will be used to construct a testbed.
The testbed will consist of 22 raspberry pi 5 16gb, 25 256gb microsd cards, A ubiquity USW-Pro-Max-24-PoE (400W)
and 25 raspberry pi 5 PoE cards
